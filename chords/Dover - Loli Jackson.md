Am           F             C        G    
Tell you my love where to hide me away
A           F             C        G
Tell you my love where to find me again
Am  D            F       C
Why cry, leggy smile I never had
A          D
Star inner style
F          G
Golden dreams that passed me by

F           F             C        G    
Tell you my love reckless nights passed away

A           F             C        G
As I tried not to hate I won't care what they say

Am  D            F       C
Why cry, leggy smile I never had

A          D
Star inner style

F          C
Golden dreams that passed me by
F          G
that passed me by

C     G
You said I'm on fire
Am    F
Well I don't think so
C           
and she said fine
G
You said no lies
Am                  F           C
Well I don't think so and she said fine
     G                  C     A
I'll close my eyes and die

F           F             C        G    
Tell you my love where to hide me away
A           F             C        G
Tell you my love where to find me again
Am  D            F       C
Why cry, leggy smile I never had
A          D
Star inner style
F          G
Golden dreams that passed me by

C     G
You said I'm on fire
Am    F
Well I don't think so
C           
and she said fine
G
You said no lies
Am                  F           C
Well I don't think so and she said fine
     G                  C     A
I'll close my eyes and die


Am     F
You rather! You rather!
Cm       G
I couldn't watch you before
Am     F
You rather! You rather!
Cm       G
I couldn't watch you before
Am     F
Now you play every night
