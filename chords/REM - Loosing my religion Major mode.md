```tab
[Intro]
 
F#m         D  E     A     A /Bm     A /C   A /D A 
F#m         D  E     A        E
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
    A               E 
Oh, life is bigger
 
It's bigger than you
            A 
And you are not me.
                        E 
The lengths that I will go to,
                     A       E 
The distance in your eyes,
                     D 
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G#dim
I set it up.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 A 
That's me in the corner,
                 E 
That's me in the spotlight
            A 
Losing my religion.
          E 
Trying to keep up with you.
      A                           E 
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     D 
Oh no, I've said too much,
                G#dim
I haven't said enough.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
  E                        F#m
I thought that I heard you laughing,
  D              G         A    A /Bm   A /C   A /D
I thought that I heard you sing.
A    F#m             D    E   A      E
I  think I thought I saw  you try.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
          A                    E 
Every whisper of every waking hour
                   A 
I'm choosing my confessions,
          E 
Trying to keep an eye on you
       A                                  E 
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                     D 
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
         A 
Consider this, consider this,
    E 
The hint of a century,
         A 
Consider this: the slip
     E 
That brought me to my knees failed.
A 
What if all these fantasies
     E 
Come    flailing around?
         D        G#dim
Now I've said too much.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
    E                       F#m
I thought that I heard you laughing,
        D         E         A    A /B   A /C   A /D
I thought that I heard you sing.
A    F#m             D   E   A     E
I  think I thought I saw you try.
