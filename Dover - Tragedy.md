A          E           F#m         D                  A
Oh oh oh oh oh it's such a tragedy, The way you look at me
   E                F#m              D             A
Oh I relied on your sympathy, That's why I used to love you
  E         F#m       D              A
Last time I saw you, You were so much kinder
  E             F#m         D     E
Now you're just blinded by rage

        A              E               F#m
I never knew how to survive, I'm deep in anger
        D              A
Will I see you one more time?
E               F#m
This is my sweet surrender
        D              A     D
Will I see you one more time
A      D
Before goodbye


A          E           F#m         D                  A
Oh oh oh oh oh it's just misogyny The way you're blaming me
   E                F#m              D             A
Oh I relied on your sanity That's why I used to adore you

  E         F#m       D              A
Last time I saw you You were so much brighter

  E             F#m         D     E
Now you're just stupefied

I never knew how to survive
I'm deep in anger
Will I see you one more time?
This is my sweet surrender
I just wanna say sometimes
I pray for you to come back
And just save my life
I will fight my last contender
Will I see you one more time
Before goodbye
Will I see you one more time
Will I see you one more time
Just one more time
Traces of hate
A failed crying for help
Life is too long
Who needs all the pain?
I fell apart
And you watched unfazed
Don't let me down tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh you said
It's time to pretend
Life is too long
Who can bare the pain?
Oh oh oh oh oh you changed and
I stayed the same
This time I'm gonna play
To win
I never knew how to survive
I'm deep in anger
Will I see you one more time?
This is my sweet surrender
I just wanna say sometimes
I pray for you to come back
And just save my life
I will fight my last contender
Will I see you one more time
Before goodbye
Before goodbye
Before goodbye (one more time)
Before goodbye (one more time)
Before goodbye
Before goodbye
