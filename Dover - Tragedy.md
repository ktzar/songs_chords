A          E           F#m         D                  A
Oh oh oh oh oh it's such a tragedy, The way you look at me
   E                F#m              D             A
Oh I relied on your sympathy, That's why I used to love you
  E         F#m       D              A
Last time I saw you, You were so much kinder
  E             F#m         D     E
Now you're just blinded by rage

        A              E               F#m
I never knew how to survive, I'm deep in anger
        D              A
Will I see you one more time?
E               F#m
This is my sweet surrender
        D              A     D
Will I see you one more time
A      D
Before goodbye


A          E           F#m         D                  A
Oh oh oh oh oh it's just misogyny The way you're blaming me
   E                F#m              D             A
Oh I relied on your sanity That's why I used to adore you

  E         F#m       D              A
Last time I saw you You were so much brighter

  E             F#m         D     E
Now you're just stupefied
