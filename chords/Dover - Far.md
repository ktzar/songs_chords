Am              F
Far is not the word
            C           G
Because I'm never far enough

Am F C G
Am F C G

Am            "               F
I've been planning this for thirty years
        "             C
No one's gonna stop me now
      "               Dm
All I need to know is what it is
          "                   Am    F
I got the balls so believe in me

    Am    F             C       G
I've got something for you little boy

    Am    F             C       G
You just wanted me dead little boy

Am            "               F
I've been drinking soda for a month
        "             C
Just in case I need to fly
      "               Dm
Yes you never know what's gonna come
          "                   Am    F
I must be ready for everything
    Am    F             C       G
I've got something for you little boy

    Am    F             C       G
You just wanted me dead little boy

Am             F                 C           G
Far is not the word because I'm never far enough

Am F C G
Down! now!
Am F C G
Now you can say goodbye

F           C
Get our of the car
Em                  Am
You won't get rid of me so fast
F               C
And put up your hands
Em          Am
Is not my fault
            F
Neither the summer's
            C
Nor the winters
        D-E         Am
It is your whole life!
